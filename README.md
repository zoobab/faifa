# Welcome to Faifa
Faifa can configure any Intellon-based Power Line Communication device using Intellon INT5000 and INT6000 series chips (6000 and 6300 chips). It supports all Intellon-specific management and control frames as well as standard management frames.

# Building

Faifa uses autotools, so you will need to type the following two commands:

```
./autogen.sh
./configure (put additionnal options here)
```

You will need the `libc6-dev`, `libpcap0.8-dev` and `libssl-dev` packages under Debian/Ubuntu to successfully compile Faifa.

# Packaging

* Debian/Ubuntu: As of September 2009, Faifa is now included in the experimental package suite. Thanks to Damien Raude-Morvan for his work on packaging Faifa. Faifa is now also available for Ubuntu systems.

# Todo

* Recover the list of devices supported
* Recover the manual
